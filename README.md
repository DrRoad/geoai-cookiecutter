# Cookiecutter GeoAI

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing GeoAI geographic data science work._

This cookiecutter template is designed to be used for GeoAI, geographic data science work utilizing ArcGIS Pro combined with Python machine learning technologies.

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 3.5+ _optionally with_ ArcPy
 - [Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with Conda:

If you are working in an environment _without_ ArcPy, an ArcGIS Pro project and File GeoDatabase will not be created, but the template will still work. In this way the template can be used in both environments, albeit with some reduced functionality if ArcPy is not available.

``` bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

``` bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/ArcGIS/geoai-cookiecutter
```

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project will look like this:
